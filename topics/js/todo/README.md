# Todo App

Learning Sapper, and wanted to play with some server rendering stuff.

Built on the [Sapper template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template)

## Commands

* `npm run dev` <- dev run
* `npm run build` <- build prod artifacts in [__sapper__/build]
* `docker-compose up` <- run prod artifacts in docker
* `npm test` <- start buildkite tests (requires local env running on [http://localhost:3000])
