# wasm-pong

Pong, with the game engine in wasm.
This is the "game engine" project.

To get the project running:

* Run `make` here
* Follow instructions in `web-pong/README.md`

## Note

This project is fairly sloppy, theres a bunch of stuff laying around (especially in physics) that 
got put in the "too hard" basket for now.

Simulates basic physics for ball bouncing around the play-space, with a simple AI to play against the player.
